# What is the VzBoT?
The VzBoT is a high speed, moderately sized 3d Printer. Originally based on the TronXY X5SA / X5S Frame, this printer was aimed at those who want more performance out of their 330x330mm sized 3d printer.

Since this era, the VzBoT project has come very far. From Aluminum CNC parts to a full kit (soon) and custom high performance hotend, the project has developed at a lightning pace to be one of the fastest printers out there.

The printers
Originally, the VZ project started with a Vz-330 by Simon Vez. Recently, Guillaume has developed his iteration of the VzBoT. This printer aims to address a few compromises with the larger sized printer, by using a 235x235 bed size (ender 3 sized). This makes sourcing the parts for this printer relatively easy. Combined with the AWD functionality (all wheel drive, 2 motors on X and 2 on Y) and shorter belt loops, this printer is for those who thrive to be the fastest.

# What will a VzBoT set me back in terms of money?
Originally, as of start of 2022, a Vz-330 would set you back as follows:

800$ if you source really well and efficiently (budget)
1000$ for the average VzBoT
1500$ for the whole shablam with alu parts, 48v, all extras etc.

Add 100-150$ for panels, and you've got yourself a very nice 3d printer.

Unfortunately, due to inflation, and other costs, this price may be a higher (think 100-200$).

Additionally, a Vz-235 will be less expensive, due to the smaller size and easily source able parts.

# Where can you buy and find parts?
 We have 2 official manufacturers for parts. Mellow 3D and F3D racing in Germany. There are resellers and we will try to keep this list up to date. Please visit the reseller section

 - F3D Racing: https://f3d-racing-fdm.myshopify.com/
 - Aliexpress and Taobao:  [Mellow Store](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1531088)
 

# What is AWD (All wheel drive)?
In conventional CoreXY machines, a 2WD setup is used. This setup utilizes 2 stepper motors at the back or front of the machine. Recently, the VzBoT project has adapted the AWD setup! This setup utilizes 2 motors on X, and 2 on Y, doubling the amount of motors for the XY plane. What are the advantages of this setup? Let's go over them:

- Having two motors on one belt allows for a shorter effective belt length. This leads to less belt stretch, which usually gives better input shaper results.
- The maximum useable acceleration is about 1.5x higher compared to 2WD due to the added torque.

We recommend using the LDO-42STH48-2504AC or 2504AH 1.8deg motors, as they give the best performance for the VzBoT's usecase.
