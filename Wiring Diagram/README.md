# PLEASE NOTE: IMPORTANT : ALWAYS CONNECT BOTH PSU DC NEGATIVE TOGETHER SO THEY HAVE THE SAME REFERENCE GROUND 
## For 48v stepstick drivers: The super 8 has 2 seperate banks of drivers. 0-2 and 3 to 7. If you want to run your Z and and E on 24v and XY on 48v, you have to use 24V on port 0-2 and place your 48v on port 3-7 for step stick driver.
## If you use the external 5160HV Pro from Mellow, then you can use the port that you want and feed 24v on both driver banks and supply 48v ONLY to the external drivers directly. 
## The new version of the External 5160HV Pro has a direct 12v Fan connection on the driver board, so no need to use a port on the Super8 for that. Connect the fans directly to the driver boards
