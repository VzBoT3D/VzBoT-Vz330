# PLEASE NOTE: 
## Wiring diagram for AWD. The super 8 v1.2 has 2 seperate bank of drivers. 0-2 and 3 to 7. If you want to run your Z and and E on 24v, you have to use 24V on port 0-2 and place your 48v on port 3-7.
Unless you use the external 5160HV Pro from Mellow, then you can can place them where you want and feed 24v on both driver banks and supply 48v to the external drivers directly.
