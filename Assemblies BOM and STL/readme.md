## Printing

Settings for printing can be found on the [Print settings](https://docs.vzbot.org/general/misc-info/print-settings/) VzBoT Docs page.

The quantity of each printed part may differ. A selection of parts are available in different variants to suit the needs of more than one possible BOM or hardware setup. These are mostly supplied for retro-compatibility, and no longer recommended for new builds. New builds are encouraged to follow the standard BOM, like the Mellow3D kits. 

Please carefully read through the filenames to assess whether the file or part applies to your machine or not.
