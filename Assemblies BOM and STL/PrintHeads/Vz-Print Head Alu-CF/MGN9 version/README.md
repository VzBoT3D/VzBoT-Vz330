Assembling the print head is straight forward.

# Step 1 : Mounting the Fan and Cable holder.

## BOM needed:
- 4xM3 6mm Ultra low profile bolts
- cable holder (printed)

# Step 2 : Assembling the carriage
- Install the top plate on the X MGN9 slider
- Install the back, front, and bottom plates

## BOM needed:
- 8xM3 6mm Ultra low profile bolts (For all 8 corners)
- 4xM3 4mm Ultra low profile bolts (for mounting top plate to MANG9 slider)

# Step 3: Mounting the the X stop switch (Optional if you don't use sensorless homing)

## BOM needed:
- 2 x M2.5 6mm Ultra low profile bolts
- 2 x M2 screws (not included in the kit)
- Microswitch https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_AL9anj
- Switch mount (Printed)

# Step 4: Install the rear adjustable fan mount

## BOM needed:
- 2 x M3 8mm Ultra low profile bolts
- 2 x M3 Nuts

# Step 5: Install the belts.
- Start by the front. Insert the end of the belt through the side slot and loop the belt on itself. Insert a piece of filament (6mm) in the loop and then slowly pull the belt back in the slot until secures in place.
- For the back, simply loop the belt arround the pillar, and give it a pre-tention on the belt, then attach it with a zip tie, or a printed belt clip (Found in the STL folder).

# Step 5.1
Take a rum shot. This step is definately needed after the belts job. It takes a bit of patience to route the belts in the front idlers, with a small screw driver, its very doable

# Step 6: Install the fan duct

## BOM needed:
- 2 x M3 10mm bolts
- 2 x M3 Nuts
- Upper fan duct (printed)
- Lower fan fuct (printed)

# Step 7: Install your favorite extruder/hotend combo.

# Step 7.1
Take a second well deserved rum shot. Please note that beer can be used in this step.

# Step 8 : Adjust the fan height
Loosen the 2 M3 8mm bolts, and ajust height according to your Hotend

## BOM needed:
(No probe):
- 1 x M3 20mm bolt - (For right side of the fan when you face printer - When NOT using probe)
- 1 x M3 25mm bolt - (for left side  Please note the left side bolt orientation is different to clear the belt)
- 1 M3 8mm (upper fan duct brace)
- 3 x M3 Nuts
(With probe):
- 2 x M3 25mm bolt - (Please note the left side bolt orientation is different to clear the belt)
- 1 x M3 8mm (upper fan duct brace)
- 2 x M3 6mm (Bltouch mount
